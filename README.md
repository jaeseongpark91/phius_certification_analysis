## Passive House Institute US Certification Case Analysis

As a former PHIKO (Passive House Institute KOrea) researcher, I became interested in PHIUS (Passive House Institute United States) certification projects data. PHIUS provides its certification projects database information in [their website](https://www.phius.org/phius-certification-for-buildings-products/certified-projects-database). In this project, we will collect and organize the USA Passive House projects data, explore the data and share some interesting findings. 

The codes are written in the Jupyter notebook **'phius_certification_database_new.ipynb'**. Please refer to this file. 


### Install
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

### Data
The dataset **'table.csv'** is created by web-scraping the [PHIUS Website](https://www.phius.org/phius-certification-for-buildings-products/certified-projects-database) done by Jaeseong Park.
